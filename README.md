# WoWGame
Attempt to recreate World of Warcraft in Unreal Engine for educational purposes.
This project is an ongoing work where if I don't have anything to do, I'm just continuing to self teach myself.

## The Goal
The goal of this project is purely educational. Not to release the game or make money off of it. 
Feel free to use this however you want, if the project helps you somewhat, then that's a bonus for me!

I am trying to keep upgrading the project and keep the best practices up to date. If you have any suggestions or alternatives, make a suggestion to the issues, I'll be eternally grateful!
