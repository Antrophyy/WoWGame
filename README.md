# WoWGame
Attempt to recreate World of Warcraft in Unreal Engine for educational purposes.
This project is an ongoing work where if I don't have anything to do, I'm just continuing to self teach myself.

## The Goal
The goal of this project is not to release the game or make money off of it. It's purely educational such that if I ever encounter a similar problem, I know at least roughly how to tackle it. 
Feel free to use this however you want, if the project helps you somewhat, then that's a bonus for me!

I am trying to keep upgrading the project and keep the best practices up to date. If you have any suggestions or alternatives, make a suggestion to the issues, I'll be eternally grateful!
